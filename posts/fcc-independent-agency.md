[Draft]

## The FCC's status as an independent agency

There's been some recent discussion surrounding the Obama administration and the Federal Communication Commission for their role in the adoption of Title II-based Open Internet regulations.

A [Wall Street Journal article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-white-house-thwarted-fcc-chief-on-internet-rules-1423097522) described White House meetings with technology companies as "a parallel version of the FCC itself". Economist and frequent FCC critic Hal Singer [described](https://twitter.com/HalSinger/status/714098473365278722) the White House's actions as "tampering". A Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee [report](/files/fcc-report-sen-ron-johnson.pdf) describes at length "the President's undue influence on the FCC's decision-making process". The Senate report highlights the FCC's status as an _independent_ agency in making the case that the White House, by weighing in publicly on a matter before the FCC, violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.

A broad discussion of the norms surrounding agency independence is outside the scope of this post. What I do hope to demonstrate, however, is that it is routine for the President, through proxies in other agencies or White House offices, to weigh in on matters before the FCC. Data from the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) makes this clear.

ECFS searches yield the following findings:

- The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) submitted at least 155 regulatory filings to the FCC from 1992 to 2012.
- The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submitted regulatory filings to the FCC in 1995, 2000, and 2001.
- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submitted a regulatory filing to the FCC in 2000.
- The General Services Administration (GSA) has submitted at least 225 regulatory filings to the FCC from 1998 to 2005.
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has submitted at least 296 regulatory filings to the FCC from 1992 to 2015.
- The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted at least 148 regulatory filings to the FCC from 2003 to 2015.
- The Department of the Interior (DOI) has at least 24 regulatory filings to the FCC from 1988 to 2012.
